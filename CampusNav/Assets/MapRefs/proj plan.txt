game setup - player runs on set path and can jump, slide, turn left + right, has follow camera, consider if the player is human (and how this affects the scale of the map)
- player ought to move along splines rather than running straight. there should be 3 parallel splines like temple run
-add turning
-add jump
-add slide


get topography 3d model - contour map creator, draw over contour lines in modelling software



add buildings - uwe map, use rough shapes, make sure buildings include an entry point



plot what is counted as possible routes - consider how to know where buildings can be walked through - doors and overhangs, include some key indoor areas



calculate best route - A* pathfinding?, Dijkstra's algorithm, bellman-ford algorithm



game finish
